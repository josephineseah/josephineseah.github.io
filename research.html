        <h2>Current Research: Interruptions in the Smart City</h2>
        <p>My doctoral research focuses on everyday negotiations in smart cities. While plans of smart urbanism are typically  driven the logics of optimization, efficiency, and seamlessness, my study foregrounds the everyday frictions, misalignments, and contingencies that shape how city dwellers inhabit and negotiate their lives and practices in these data-driven cities. Thus, my project introduces the concept of <em>interruption</em>--glitches, breakdowns, and everyday acts of tinkering--as moments that render visible the limits of and the multiplicities within smart urbanism.</p> 
<p>The project seeks to bridge the literature between smart and platform urbanism with scholarship on infrastructures and infrastructuring in science and technology studies (STS).</p>
